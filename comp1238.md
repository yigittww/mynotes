Week 1 - History of Writing

Early writing systems began with clay tablets in Mesopotamia (~5,000 years ago).

Cuneiform was initially used for practical records like receipts.

The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the oldest literary works (~4,000 years old).

The Phoenician alphabet influenced many modern alphabets.

Week 2 - Bits and Bytes

Computers use the binary system (0s and 1s) to represent all data.

A byte consists of 8 bits, and each byte can represent a number from 0 to 255.

ASCII maps numbers to characters, while Unicode extends this to more characters.

Volatile memory (RAM) loses data when powered off; non-volatile memory (SSD, HDD) retains it.

Week 3 - Structure of Text

Markdown is a simple way to format text using symbols like # for headings and * for emphasis.

HTML provides structured formatting with tags like <p>, <ul>, and <strong>.

JSON is a lightweight format used for data exchange: { "key": "value" }.

Unicode encodings like UTF-8 ensure text compatibility across different languages and platforms.

Week 4 - Manipulating Text & Text Editors

Mastery of keyboard shortcuts improves efficiency in coding and text manipulation.

VS Code is a powerful text editor with extensions for customization.

Regular expressions (regex) help find and replace patterns in text efficiently.

Version control systems like Git enable tracking changes and collaboration.

Week 5 - Command Line Interfaces

The command line interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for interacting with the computer efficiently.

Essential commands include ls (list files), cd (change directory), and mkdir (create directory).

Redirection (> and |) allows sending output from one command to another.

SSH (Secure Shell) enables remote access to servers securely.
